# crazyserver

_A cross-platform, install-less, dependency-less server for a fleet of Crazyflies_

The crazyserver is written in Go, enabling it to be cross-platform, install-less and dependency-less. One day, it will provide a clean, programming-language-agnostic (via ZeroMQ) interface to controlling a fleet of Crazyflies.

It doesn't work yet, but it's getting there ;-)
